    description: `<strong>Recently,</strong> <p>Google announced it was laying off approximately 6% of its workforce (or 12,000 people). This brings it in line with most of the rest of the tech industry. The reason given by a publicly contrite CEO was that they’d overhired in the boom following the COVID pandemic and that now they had to address it but they were oh-so-sorry and took full responsibility. Like many others my first reaction to this rationale was “bullshit”. I imagine the same is true for the people at Meta, Amazon, Microsoft et al going through this. I spent 10 years at Google so I have some views on how these things come about and they don’t reflect well on the people running the company.
        Before getting into that it’s worth noting that all publicly listed companies operate under a fiduciary duty to act for the benefit of their shareholders. This has been enshrined since the (in)famous case of Dodge vs Ford Motor Company (1919). The backstory there was that Henry Ford wanted to reduce payments to shareholders on the basis of being able to offer cheaper cars to his customers and better wages to his staff. At the time Ford said.
        My ambition is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their homes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.</p>
        The Dodge brothers owned 10% of Ford and opposed this and took Ford to court because they wanted the payments to be able to start their own company. They won and Ford was not allowed to lower prices or raise salaries at the company. It’s worth understanding that if you have a sufficiently vocal group of shareholders with the resources to take you to court then you have to be able to show you are acting in their best interests. Shareholders have primacy in terms of a company’s priorities. This almost enshrines seeking short term profit over longer term thinking by giving activist investors a stick to threaten you with.
        This stands at the heart of the current situations being faced by companies like Google today. There are institional investors with the means to take them to court and these investors see Google as a company that is wasteful that they can extract more value from. That’s not to say you have to maximise profits (thanks to those that pointed out my imperfect understanding of US corporate law in the comments and on HN) but it does enable pressure to be put on you. I do not envy the people trying to navigate this. At its heart this is a problem about unrestrained capitalism.
        <p>When Google went public, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were aware of the risks posed by public ownership and went to a lot of effort to ensure they could maintain control over the company. They even attempted to set expectations as to how they wanted the company to operate in their Founders’ Letter to investors.
        </p><p>As a private company, we have concentrated on the long term, and this has served us well. As a public company, we will do the same. In our opinion, outside pressures too often tempt companies to sacrifice long term opportunities to meet quarterly market expectations.
        In the many years since that original letter the company has changed beyond recognition. As well as the oft quoted “Don’t be evil” mantra the company has grown to nearly 200,000 full time employees and a market cap of over a trillion dollars. Because it has been such a good long term bet, large investors have flocked to own stock in the company and it has served them well over a long period of time. So, why are they becoming restless now?
        Along the way some other big tech companies rose up and a war erupted to hire the best talent. This has led to spiralling compensation packages. Google has also continued growing rapidly (roughly 22,000 people hired to the end of 2022). If you look at the median compensation $300,000 then you could say that those 22,000 people added $6.6 billion in salary overheads alone over the course of 2022. An eye watering sum. Though perhaps not so much if the company is making $16 billion profit EVERY SINGLE quarter despite that. Investors look at this and wonder if they’ve gotten that value back.
        And, to be fair, investors have a point. Google is incredibly wasteful in the way it deploys people. However, by taking the blunt force approach to headcount reduction they’re not addressing the root causes of these and actually harming themselves in the long run. There are no studies which show that downsizing a company this way leads to improvements in productivity. In fact there is lots of evidence that they’ll lose out because people will be more averse to risk and have lower trust in their leadership.
        </p><p>The way the company has gone about it, too, leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Finding out that you no longer have a job because you can’t log in any more (sometimes in cases where someone is on call for protecting your production systems) is no way to fire anyone. That’s like being in an abusive relationship with some kind of narcissistic sociopath. First off you get showered with praise for having made the cut and lots of fancy perks. Then you get fired by text message and ghosted. Then you’re told to be grateful for the generous severance package. The managers and teams of people fired this way will be devastated. The people fired this way will spend years putting their self esteem back together. The senior leadership all had a part to play in this. They chose the expedient answer — possibly by convincing themselves they were managing risk and taking the Macbeth approach of “If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well
        It were done quickly”.</p>
        <p>So, to recap. Google’s leadership have done a stupid thing — mass firing — in stupid way. The problem they’re trying to solve is “how do we get rid of enough people to make investors happier?” and the outcome is “have 6% less people”. Behaving like Elon Musk isn’t the sort of thing any empathetic leadership group should aspire to. To be fair there is no good way to fire 12,000 people but there are ways which are more humane than others. All of which is a distraction from the fundamental question — why is Google so wasteful?
        The answer this question lies in personal ambition. At the senior echelons of the company there aren’t enough VP jobs to go around for a group of highly motivated, ambitious and (increasingly) ruthless people. I’ve loitered around the edges of this world and a large part of my value was to insulate my teams from ever having to experience it. It’s like Game of Thrones played out through email and calendar and over video call.
        In order to get promoted to senior levels (starting from director up) your organisation needs to look a certain way. There are boxes you have to tick including having the right people at the right levels underneath you. The long term approach to this would be to grow your people and that this will naturally happen if you’re working on things that matter. The trouble is that this takes time and you’re never more than 6–18 months away from a potential reorg that might make you start again from scratch. Ambitious people also tend to be impatient. So, what do you do?
        You start vanity projects and hire. You hire in people at the right job levels so your organisation has the “right” shape to it. You chase after vanity metrics about you looking good like active users rather than how useful your product is. You use your authority to subvert the promotion process so that your promo candidates get through even if they don’t deserve it. You avoid performance managing people out because every headcount matters in your quest to make the next jump. You step back from confronting your peers over toxic behaviour because you need their support for promotion. Eventually your cargo cult gets you where you want to go.
        </p>Another reason that Google is wasteful is that it’s too easy. The people inside it don’t see it as a business as they don’t have to struggle against the market forces everyone else has to deal with. Why would you when ads is so profitable? This complacency means senior leaders often follow their personal agendas above all else. Empires rise and fall. Too often I saw that personal ambition trump doing the right thing for users, the business or employees. The root cause is the leadership because it’s their personal ambition over running their part of Google like a business. I’ve seen people promoted to VP based on a set or vague promises they haven’t delivered, mass hiring and vanity metrics. Google can go to great lengths to protect people in senior leadership positions way beyond what they would do for the rank and file.
        <p>The people being affected by the layoffs are not the people who’ve made and benefited from those decisions. The people who will benefit from the stock price bump. The people who will post on LinkedIn how it is about misjudging the market and how they’re so sorry and take full responsibility. The people in the dark rooms deciding who will go and who will stay while their personal wealth accumulates. The investors who just want another billion in the bank account. If Google wanted to make a meaningful change then addressing the bloated layers of senior management would be the place to start but — as they say — turkeys don’t vote for Christmas. It should look at why it is wasteful and take the hard decisions to address it. A 6% reduction is a blunt tool which is basically an admission that you aren’t running your company as a business properly. If that’s the case — why aren’t the people running the business the ones shortly to be entering the job market?
        At the end of this, the root causes of Google’s wastefulness won’t have been addressed. The execs may never recover the trust they’ve lost by the way they’ve approached this. Creativity will have been stifled. Business performance won’t improve. Google will have drifted further from its founding vision to the loss of us all. Large investors now know they can flex their muscles and Google’s CEO will cave in. The rich will get richer and will learn to rationalise the 12,000 people they left by the wayside. The cycle will start again.
        It doesn’t have to be this way. In 2013, Nintendo’s boss said he would not fire anyone to please shareholders. In 2017 they launched the Switch. Over that period Nintendo’s stock has increased by a factor of nearly five which is 19% a year (including the drop most of the stock market experienced last year). Google has missed a golden opportunity to make better use of 12,000 highly talented human beings. All in the name of keeping some rich people happy.
        Epilogue: everything I’ve written about above I have seen personally play out many times during the time I spent at Google. I’ve also seen incredible people rewarded for doing the right thing. My experience is that gets rarer the higher you get in the hierarchy.</p>`,

    description: `<p>React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework according to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. In this article, I will introduce you to a UI library called “React-Bootstrap”, which delivers wonderful UI components. Many React UI libraries are available on the internet, but React-Bootstrap is by far the most popular choice among web developers. Thanks to the creators for maintaining its similarity with the standard Bootstrap framework and the availability of a wide range of Bootstrap themes.
        4-Step Guide To Integrate React-Bootstrap UI Library in React
        Installing React-Bootstrap
        Importing the Asset Files into the Application
        Importing Components
        Using Components</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Installing React-Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>Open a terminal in your React project and execute the following command to start installing the package using NPM (node package manager).
        npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
        If you prefer to use yarn, then execute the following command.
        yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap
        The above command will install two packages — Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap. The purpose of installing Bootstrap in addition to React-Bootstrap is: The React-Bootstrap package does not ship with any CSS. It only contains the components. Therefore, it needs an additional package to include the CSS files.
        </p><h3>Step 2: Importing the Asset Files into the Application</h3>
        <p>Open index.js, and add the following line to include the CSS file of the Bootstrap framework.
        import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
        You can now start using the React-Bootstrap UI library and its components in your app.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Importing Components</h3>
        <p>You can import the components of React Bootstrap by specifying the name of the bootstrap component and its package name. Add the following line to import a button into a React page.
        import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
        You must import individual components as demonstrated above, rather than the entire library. Because it only includes the specific components that you use. By doing this, you can significantly reduce the amount of code you send to the client.
        </p><h3>Step 4: Using Components</h3>
        <p>Here is how you can use any Bootstrap component in your React app. I will demonstrate a few, but you can refer to the official documentation to see all the components.
        Button Component
        Alert Component
        Spinner Component</p>
        <h3>4.1. Button Component</h3>
        <p>Import the component by adding the following line to the top of the page.
        import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
        You can then use props on the imported component to change its layout. For example, Button has numerous props like variant, type, target, size, etc. Refer to the following code snippet to display a button.
        </p>`,

      "Are you or your team struggling with GraphQL concepts or does it feel too heavy weight for what you are building?",
    image_Address: "https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/graphql-reasons.png",

    description: `<h3>Strengths of GraphQL</h3>
        <h4>Developer Experience</h4>
        It’s straightforward to add new types and fields to your API, and similarly straightforward for your clients to begin using those fields. This is the biggest benefit to using GraphQL and having the flexibility when designing your API.
        <h4>One API for Many Clients</h4>
        If you have a website, an Android app, and an iOS app, having the flexibility to tune the data that each requests and give them to control when they want to receive that data truly feels amazing. Instead of maintaining multiple APIs (mobile and web), you can invest all that energy into a single API and reduce a lot of overhead in both development AND in data across the wire.
        <h4>Performance</h4>
        Typically with a REST API there are multiple calls to accomplish a task or get detail data for each item in a list. E.g. give me a list of items, then make a second call to get the detail of one or more of them to display to the user. With GraphQL you can get all of the detail data alongside the list with 1 API call instead of two.
        <h3>Recognizing the flaws</h3>
        <h4>Error Handling</h4>
        Error handling is always an interesting topic when it comes to GraphQL. With REST APIs you have specific HTTP codes that are returned when an event happens. A catastrophic or unexpected error usually results in a 500, a bad request that contains bad data usually results in a 400. This lets you check if something returns ok or error using Promises in your frontend code and then handle errors appropriately.
        With GraphQL you are left to your own devices because everything returns a 200 and you then tack on an error object that you have to parse to see if there was actually an error.
        If you have complex error handling then this is where your frontend code can get REALLY complex handling all the errors from the backend and trying to make heads or tails of what the correct HTML to show to the user is.
        If you are dealing with complex error handling then really think when bringing in or continuing to use GraphQL.
        <h4>Verbose Schemas</h4>
        For this specific app we used Ktor instead of Spring Boot, which is pretty standard and doesn’t come with a lot of bells and whistles out of the box. Coming from many years of Ruby programming, it feels a lot like Sinatra.
        There is a good amount of magic with the GraphQL library we pulled in where you implement an interface (Subscription, Query, Mutation) and then things just kind of worked. But you have to define these JsonTypeInfo annotations in quite a few places so that you get the serialization to work with fasterxml-jackson.`,

        As technology continues to advance, algorithms have become an integral part of our everyday lives. From the moment we wake up and check our phones to the moment we go to bed, algorithms are working behind the scenes to make our lives easier and more efficient. But what exactly are these algorithms, and how do they affect us? In this article, we’ll explore the different types of algorithms we use in our day-to-day lives and examine some of the most common examples.
One of the most widespread algorithms that we use on a daily basis is the search algorithm. Search algorithms like Google’s PageRank algorithm and Bing’s MSNBot algorithm are used to determine the relevance of web pages to a given search query, and to rank them accordingly. These algorithms scan through millions of web pages, analyzing their content and backlinks to determine which pages are most relevant to a user’s query. This allows us to quickly find the information we’re looking for, whether it’s a news article, a product, or a service.
Another type of algorithm that we use regularly is the recommender system. Recommender systems like Netflix’s Cinematch algorithm, Amazon’s item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithm and YouTube’s video recommendation algorithm use machine learning techniques to recommend products or content to users based on their browsing history and preferences. These algorithms analyze the data collected from our browsing history, search queries, and purchase history to suggest similar content or products we might be interested in.
Social media algorithms also play a big role in our daily lives. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter use algorithms to determine which posts and updates to show users based on factors like relevance, timeliness and popularity. These algorithms determine which posts are most likely to be of interest to the user, based on their interactions, likes, and shares, and prioritize them in the user’s feed.
We also use image recognition algorithms daily. Image recognition algorithms like Google’s TensorFlow and Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit are used to identify objects, scenes and activities in images and videos. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from facial recognition to object detection in self-driving cars.
Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms are also increasingly present in our lives. NLP algorithms like Google’s BERT, GPT-3 and Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services are used to understand, interpret and generate human language. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, including voice assistants, chatbots, and machine translation.
Another important area where algorithms are used is in fraud detection. Fraud detection algorithms like Random Forest algorithm, SVM and ANN are used to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions and other areas. These algorithms analyze patterns in data, such as transaction history, to detect any anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity.
Self-driving car algorithms also play a crucial role in our daily life. Self-driving car algorithms like Waymo’s self-driving car algorithm, Tesla’s Autopilot algorithm, and Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group algorithm are used to navigate roads and make decisions about when to brake, accelerate and turn. These algorithms use data from cameras, LIDAR, and other sensors to sense the environment and make driving decisions.
We also rely on weather forecasting algorithms to plan our daily activities. Weather forecasting algorithms like the Global Forecast System (GFS) algorithm, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) algorithm, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) algorithm are used to predict and analyze weather patterns. These algorithms process large amounts of data from weather stations, satellites, and other sources to provide forecasts that help us plan our day.
In the field of medicine, algorithms play an important role in helping doctors and researchers make more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. Medical diagnosis algorithms like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) algorithm, the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) algorithm and the Logistic Regression algorithm are used to analyze medical data and help identify patterns that indicate specific illnesses or conditions. These algorithms can also be used to predict the likelihood of a patient developing certain diseases, allowing doctors to intervene early and prevent illness.
Finally, optimization algorithms are used to solve complex optimization problems in various fields such as transportation, logistics, engineering, and finance. Algorithms like the Simplex algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, and the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm are used to find the best solution to a problem by analyzing a large number of possible solutions and selecting the one that is most optimal. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from scheduling to logistics, and help to make processes more efficient and cost-effective.
Here are a few more examples of algorithms that are used in our everyday lives in more detail:
<strong>Image compression algorithms:</strong> Image compression algorithms like JPEG, PNG, and GIF are used to reduce the file size of images, making them quicker to download and easier to share. These algorithms work by removing redundant data and reducing the number of colors in an image, while still maintaining its quality.
<strong>Error-correcting codes (ECC) algorithm:</strong> Error-correcting codes (ECC) algorithms like Reed-Solomon code, Hamming code and Low-density parity-check (LDPC) code are used to detect and correct errors in data transmission. These algorithms add redundant information to data, allowing the receiver to detect and correct errors that may have occurred during transmission.
<strong>Cryptographic algorithms:</strong> Cryptographic algorithms like RSA, AES and SHA-256 are used to encrypt and decrypt data, making it more secure and private. These algorithms use mathematical operations to scramble data in such a way that it can only be decrypted by someone with the correct key.
<strong>Data compression algorithms:</strong> Data compression algorithms like Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) and Huffman coding are used to reduce the size of files, making them quicker to download and easier to share. These algorithms work by analyzing the statistical properties of data and replacing repetitive patterns with shorter codes.
<strong>Control system algorithms:</strong> Control system algorithms like Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller, Model predictive control (MPC) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) are used to control systems, machines, and processes. These algorithms use mathematical models to predict the behavior of a system and adjust inputs to achieve the desired outcome.
<strong>Decision Tree algorithms:</strong> Decision Tree algorithms like ID3, C4.5 and CART are used to build models that can predict outcomes based on input data. These algorithms use a tree-like structure to represent decisions and outcomes, and can be used for a wide range of applications such as classification, regression and feature selection.
<strong>Game AI algorithms:</strong> Game AI algorithms like Min-Max algorithm, Alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search are used to create intelligent computer opponents in games like chess, go and other strategy games. These algorithms use simulations and mathematical models to predict the best move for the computer player.
<strong>Routing algorithms:</strong> Routing algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and A* algorithm are used to find the shortest or most efficient path between two points in a network. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, including transportation networks and the internet.
<strong>Clustering algorithms:</strong> Clustering algorithms like K-means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN are used to group similar data points together. These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, such as image segmentation, market segmentation and anomaly detection.
<strong>Neural networks:</strong> Neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions or classifications. These algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and are used in a wide range of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing and predictive modeling.
🔥 Algorithms are being developed and used in all fields, from agriculture to zoology, and they play an increasingly important role in our everyday lives.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In summary, algorithms are a fundamental part of our daily lives, and they are used in a wide range of fields. Whether it’s searching for information, connecting with friends and family, or simply navigating our environment, algorithms help us to make sense of the world around us and make our lives more convenient and efficient. Understanding the different types of algorithms and how they are used can help us to better understand how technology is shaping our world.`,
